# Project Devla

## Tools I used

ES Lint, ES6+ Snippets, Tailwind CSS framework

## NPM packages

react-router-dom, tailwindcss, axios

## How to start it

Clone project to ./ and run "npm install" and then run "npm start".

## Project Structure

I have divided the project into components, small reusable elements in the projects.

##

Also, we have a folder named Views where every file is one Route.

## Things I notice

There is an obvious problem with prop handling; every data manipulation is painstakingly hard. That is unnecessary if we use Redux which saves data in a globally available place. (Redux Store)
